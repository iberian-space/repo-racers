# Inclusion in Code Review at Repo Racers

Inclusion in code reviews is pivotal for fostering a positive and productive work environment, especially given the diverse, global nature of our teams at Repo Racers. Effective communication during code reviews not only impacts team morale but also welcomes and integrates new developers into our teams, encouraging a culture of mutual respect and continuous learning.

## Types and Examples of Non-Inclusive Code Review Behavior

Non-inclusive behaviors in code reviews can manifest in various ways, including, but not limited to:

- **Inequitable Review Assignments**:
  - For instance, overburdening certain team members with review tasks while excluding others.
- **Negative Interpersonal Interactions**:
  - Engaging in prolonged debates over subjective matters such as coding styles.
- **Biased Decision Making**:
  - Making comments about the developer instead of focusing on the code, or assuming a developer's code is of a certain quality based on past perceptions.

## Practices for Inclusive Code Reviews

Adopting inclusive practices in code reviews can greatly enhance team cohesion and code quality:

- Ensure equitable distribution of PR review assignments across the team.
- Distinguish between opinions, personal preferences, best practices, and facts in review comments to minimize subjective disputes.
- Utilize inclusive language and a constructive tone in comments.
- Encourage PR authors to express gratitude for constructive feedback.
- Apply the sandwich feedback method, especially with newcomers: start and end with positive feedback, with suggestions for improvement in between.

## Guidelines for the Author

- Write clear, maintainable code that facilitates easy review.
- Be open to seeking and incorporating feedback.
- Provide concise responses to reviewer inquiries.
- Break down changes into smaller, manageable commits to facilitate easier review and avoid bias.

## Guidelines for the Reviewer

- Approach each review with a presumption of positive intent from the author.
- Provide detailed, constructive feedback.
- Focus discussions on the code itself rather than subjective style preferences.
- Offer suggestions rather than directives, empowering the author to make informed decisions.
- Engage in direct communication with the author for clarifications instead of making assumptions.

## Culture and Code Reviews

Cultural differences and communication styles can influence code review dynamics. Recognizing and respecting these differences, while assuming positive intent, is crucial in maintaining a respectful and inclusive review process.

## Addressing Impostor Syndrome

Impostor syndrome can make the code review process daunting for both authors and reviewers. Overcoming this involves:

- Adhering to established guidelines to ensure code quality.
- Seeking collaborative opportunities for learning and improvement.
- Recognizing the value of diverse perspectives in enhancing code quality.
- Engaging in pair reviews for deeper understanding and connection.
