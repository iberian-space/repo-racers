# How We Roll

Drawing inspiration from various Agile frameworks such as Scrum, Scrumban, Extreme Programming (XP), Lean Agile, and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), we've tailored our practices to promote efficiency, flexibility, and team cohesion.

## Core Principles

- **Role Nomenclature**: We adopt the title **"process lead"** instead of "scrum master" to more accurately reflect the responsibilities of guiding our processes and facilitating our Agile practices.
- **Crew Identity**: Our 'crew' encompasses every individual contributing to a projectâ€”spanning developers, project managers, process leads, and other stakeholders, emphasizing our collaborative effort.
- **Agile Commitment**: While our foundation is Agile, we have a pronounced inclination towards [Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/scrumban/) due to its flexibility in managing work flows and its hybrid approach, enhancing our project adaptability and response times.
