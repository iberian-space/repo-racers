# Scrumban

Welcome to the starting point for our crew's journey through the world of Scrum, Kanban and Agile. This guide is tailor-made for us, there are many ways to do Agile, this is how we do it.

## [Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/scrumban/)

Developed by Core Ladas and a hybrid of Scrum and Kanban we like [Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/scrumban/) as it gives us both a heartbeat of a delivery cadence and the flexibility of continuous delivery. We basically use Kanban to manage work items within the Scrum framework.

With Scrum as our foundation, we focus on fostering teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress towards clearly defined goals. [Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/scrumban/) provides us with a structured, yet adaptable, approach to managing our complex projects.

- [The Basics](./basics/backlog_management.md): Begin our adventure by delving into the Scrum methodology, understanding its core values, and principles.
- [How We Roll](./how_we_roll/how_we_roll.md): Discover the 'special sauce' that make us an effective crew, including our roles, responsibilities, and what we expect from each other.
- [Beyond The Basics](./beyond_the_basics/backlog_management/backlog_management.md): Advance our knowledge with deeper insights into Agile and Scrum practices, learning new tools and techniques to tackle our upcoming challenges.
