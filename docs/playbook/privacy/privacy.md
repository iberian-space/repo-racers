# Overview

This part of the playbook focuses on privacy design guidelines and principles.
Private data handling and protection requires both the proper design of software,
systems and databases, as well as the implementation of organizational processes and procedures.

As close partners of Microsft and GitHub in general, developers working on Repo Racers projects should adhere to Microsoft's recommended standard practices and regulations on Privacy and Data Handling.

The playbook currently contains two main parts:

1. [Privacy and Data](data_handling.md): Best practices for properly handling sensitive and private data.
2. [Privacy frameworks](privacy_frameworks.md): A list of frameworks which could be applied in private data scenarios.
