# Projects and Repositories

Every source code repository should include documentation that is specific to it (e.g., in a Wiki within the repository), while the project itself should include general documentation that is common to all its associated repositories (e.g., in a Wiki within the backlog management tool).

## Documentation specific to a repository

- Introduction
- Getting started
  - Onboarding
  - Setup: programming language, frameworks, platforms, tools, etc.
  - Sandbox environment
  - Working agreement
  - Contributing guide
- Structure: folders, projects, etc.
- How to compile, test, build, deploy the solution/each project
  - Different OS versions
  - Command line + editors/IDEs
- [Design Decision Logs](../../design/design_reviews/decision_log/decision_log.md)
  - [Architecture Decision Record (ADRs)](../../design/design_reviews/decision_log/decision_log.md#architecture_decision_record_(ADR))
  - [Trade Studies](../../design/design_reviews/trade_studies/trade_studies.md)

Some sections in the documentation of the repository might point to the projectâ€™s documentation (e.g., Onboarding, Working Agreement, Contributing Guide).
