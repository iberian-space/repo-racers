# Engineering Feedback

Good engineering feedback is:

- Actionable
- Specific
- Detailed
  - Includes assets (script, data, code, etc.) to reproduce scenario and validate solution
  - Includes details about the customer scenario / what the customer was trying to achieve

Refer to [Microsoft Engineering Feedback](../../engineering_feedback/README.md) for more details, including [guidance](../../engineering_feedback/feedback_guidance.md), [FAQ](../../engineering_feedback/feedback_faq.md) and [examples](../../engineering_feedback/feedback_examples.md).
