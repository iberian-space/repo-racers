# Pull Requests

When we create [Pull Requests](../../code_reviews/pull_requests.md), we must ensure they are properly documented:

- Title and Description
  - [Pull Request Description](../../code_reviews/pull_requests.md#pull_request_description)
  - [Pull Request Template](../../code_reviews/pull_request_template.md)
- Linked worked items
- Comments
  - As an author, [address all comments](../../code_reviews/process_guidance/author_guidance.md#be_open_to_receive_feedback)
  - As a reviewer, [make comments clear](../../code_reviews/process_guidance/reviewer_guidance.md)
