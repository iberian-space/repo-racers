# Design Review Recipes

Design reviews come in all shapes and sizes. There are also different items to consider when creating a design at different stages during an engagement

## Design Review Process

- [Incorporate design reviews throughout the lifetime of an engagement](./engagement_process.md)

## Design Review Templates

### [Game Plan](./high_level_design_recipe.md)

- The same template already in use today
- High level architecture and design
- Includes technologies, languages & products to complete engagement objective

### [Milestone / Epic Design Review](./milestone_epic_design_review_recipe.md)

- Should be considered when an engagement contains multiple milestones or epics
- Design should be more detailed than game plan
- May require unique deployment, security and/or privacy characteristics from other milestones

### [Feature/story design review](./feature_story_design_review_template.md)

- Design for complex features or stories
- Will reuse deployment, security and other characteristics defined within game plan or milestone
- May require new libraries, OSS or patterns to accomplish goals

### [Task design review](./task_design_review_template.md)

- Highly detailed design for a complex tasks with many unknowns
- Will integrate into higher level feature/component designs
