# Elite Membership Program

![Elite Membership](./assets/images/elite_membership.webp)

Welcome to the Elite Membership Program by Repo Racers, a privileged pathway to exclusive services and innovations offered by Repo Racers. Our program follows a sponsorware release strategy, allowing us to provide our members with early access to cutting-edge features and personalized support. Discover how your sponsorship can drive technological advancement and streamline your development workflow.

## What is the Elite Membership Program?

The Elite Membership Program is an exclusive offering, designed as a private consultation and development service. This program is hosted in a secure, private channel, ensuring that new features and enhancements are accessible to our elite members before they're released to the public.

## Our Sponsorware Strategy

Every new product and service is linked to a funding goal, which, when achieved, allows us to develop and release these innovations to all our clients. However, Elite Members enjoy immediate benefits and access as soon as they are developed.

## Benefits of Sponsorship

By joining the Elite Membership Program, you are directly contributing to the sustainability of the Repo Racers community. Your sponsorship allows us to allocate precious resources, primarily time, towards the development of new features, enhanced support, and overall project sustainability.

## What's in It for You?

As an Elite Member, you gain instant access to a suite of exclusive features and benefits:

## How to Become an Elite Member

At Repo Racers, we're currently accepting sponsorship exclusively from corporate and enterprise partners.

To initiate the sponsorship process, please reach out to us via email at [elite@reporacers.com](mailto:elite@reporacers.com). Our team will promptly respond to your inquiry and schedule a discussion to understand your expectations from our sponsorship program.

During this consultation, we'll collaborate to determine how we can work together to achieve the most beneficial outcomes for both parties. Once we've established mutual understanding and alignment, we'll proceed to create a working agreement outlining the terms and expectations of our partnership.

Following the agreement, we'll guide you through an onboarding process to integrate your organization into our GitHub and Discord channels. This ensures seamless access to our exclusive Elite Membership benefits and resources.

## Funding Goals

Our current monthly sponsorship goal is $20,000. Achieving this will allow us to roll out the next set of products we're developing.
