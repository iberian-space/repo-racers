# Pre-commit Hooks Integration

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to maintain the high quality and consistency of contributions to our GitHub repository. This guide is aimed at developers who are looking to contribute to our project, providing insights into our setup and the benefits of using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks.

## What are [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) Hooks?

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks are scripts that run automatically before each commit is finalized, ensuring that the code being committed meets certain predefined standards. This can include style checks, formatting rules, and running tests. In our project, we've configured these hooks within the development container, making it easier for developers to adhere to our coding standards from the get-go.

## Configuration in the Dev Container

Upon creating a development environment using our dev container, [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks are configured and installed as a task in Visual Studio Code. This seamless integration ensures that every commit you make is automatically checked against our project's standards, without any additional setup required on your end.

## Why Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) Hooks?

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks offer several benefits that align with our project's commitment to quality and efficiency:

1. **Consistency:** They help maintain a consistent coding style across the project, making the code easier to read and maintain.
2. **Early Detection:** By catching issues early in the development process, [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks save time and effort that would otherwise be spent on fixing problems later.
3. **Streamlined Contributions:** For contributors, these hooks simplify the submission process by ensuring that code meets the project's standards before submission, reducing the back and forth during code review.
4. **Automated Checks:** They automate the mundane aspects of code review, allowing reviewers to focus on the more critical aspects of the contribution.

## Getting Started with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) Hooks

To get started, ensure that you're working within the dev container for our project. The [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks will run automatically before each commit. If a hook fails, it will block the commit, providing feedback on what needs to be corrected. Follow the instructions provided by the hook to make the necessary changes, and try committing again.

By integrating [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks into our workflow, we aim to improve the overall quality of contributions and streamline the development process for our project. We believe that these tools are instrumental in building a robust, reliable codebase, and we're excited to see the contributions you'll bring to our project.
