# Definition of Ready

Before a Product Backlog Item (PBI) is considered "ready" for sprint inclusion, it must satisfy the following criteria:

## Clarity
- The PBI has a clear, concise description detailing the what, why, and value.
- Acceptance criteria are specified, outlining the conditions for completion.

## Feasibility
- Assessed as technically feasible with the current technology stack and skills.
- All external dependencies identified and resolved or planned for.

## Size
- The PBI is appropriately sized to be completed within a single sprint.

## Prioritized
- The PBI has been prioritized against other items in the backlog.

## Estimable
- The team has estimated the effort required using their preferred technique (e.g., story points, T-shirt sizes).

## Team Consensus
- There is consensus among the team, including product owners, developers, and other stakeholders, that the PBI is ready.

## User-Centric
- The PBI articulates clear user or business value, justifying its priority.

## Notes for the Crew

- Ensure all checklist items are reviewed and ticked off during backlog refinement sessions or before sprint planning.
- Encourage open discussions about each criterion to ensure shared understanding and agreement.
- Adjustments to the checklist should be made collaboratively, reflecting lessons learned and evolving project needs.
- This checklist is a living document. It should evolve as the team learns and adapts its processes.
