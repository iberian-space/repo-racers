# Our Crew's Definition of Ready

To declare a Product Backlog Item (PBI) as "ready" for inclusion in our sprints, it must meet the comprehensive criteria set forth below:

## Clarity

- **Well-Defined Objective:** The PBI must articulate a specific goal or functionality, detailing the what, the why, and the value to the user or business.
- **Detailed Acceptance Criteria:** It includes precise, measurable conditions that must be met for the PBI to be considered complete, facilitating clarity and consensus on the definition of done.

## Feasibility

- **Technical Viability:** Assessed and confirmed to be technically feasible within our current technology ecosystem, leveraging our collective skills and expertise.
- **Dependencies Managed:** All external dependencies are identified, with strategies in place to address or mitigate them, ensuring no roadblocks to progress.

## Size

- **Sprint Compatible:** Sized to fit comfortably within a sprint, considering our velocity and capacity, to avoid spillover and ensure achievable delivery targets.
- **Breakdown and Refinement:** Larger items are broken down into smaller, manageable pieces that can be completed within a sprint, enhancing focus and delivery predictability.

## Prioritization

- **Aligned with Strategy:** Clearly prioritized based on strategic value, urgency, and impact on project objectives, ensuring that we're always working on what matters most.
- **Stakeholder Consensus:** Prioritization reflects a consensus among stakeholders, including product owners and the development team, balancing business needs and technical considerations.

## Estimability

- **Collaboratively Estimated:** The effort required is estimated by the team, using techniques like planning poker to ensure a shared understanding and commitment.
- **Reflective of Complexity and Effort:** Estimates consider the complexity, effort, and potential uncertainties, fostering realistic planning and allocation.

## Team Consensus

- **Unified Agreement:** Full team consensus on the PBI's readiness, ensuring everyone is on board, understands the scope, and is committed to delivering the expected outcomes.
- **Open Discussion:** Encourages robust discussion and questions, ensuring any concerns are addressed and resolved before commitment.

## User-Centric

- **User Benefits Clear:** The PBI clearly demonstrates how it benefits the user or enhances the business value, justifying its inclusion and priority in the sprint.
- **User Feedback Incorporated:** Where possible, incorporates user feedback or insights to ensure that the solution meets real user needs and preferences.

## Implementation Notes for Our Crew

- **Engage in Rigorous Refinement Sessions:** Utilize backlog refinement sessions to diligently assess and confirm each criterion, ensuring no PBI is prematurely considered ready.
- **Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement:** Regularly revisit and refine our Definition of Ready, incorporating learnings and feedback to evolve our practices.
- **Encourage Full Participation and Ownership:** Every team member, from developers to product owners, actively participates in defining and agreeing on the readiness of PBIs, fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility.
