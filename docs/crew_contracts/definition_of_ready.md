# Definition of Ready

A great definition of "ready" for an Agile product backlog item (PBI) indicates that the item is sufficiently prepared, understood, and actionable for the development team to begin work on it in an upcoming sprint. This definition typically ensures that all necessary prerequisites for starting work on the PBI have been met.

Before our crew considers a Product Backlog Item (PBI) "ready" for sprint inclusion, it must satisfy the following criteria:

## Clarity

The PBI has a clear, concise description detailing the what, why, and value.

Acceptance criteria are specified, outlining the conditions for completion.

## Feasibility

Assessed as technically feasible with the current technology stack and skills.

All external dependencies identified and resolved or planned for.

## Size

The PBI is appropriately sized to be completed within a single sprint.

## Prioritized

The PBI has been prioritized against other items in the backlog.

## Estimable

The team has estimated the effort required using their preferred technique (e.g., story points, T-shirt sizes).

## Team Consensus

There is consensus among the team, including product owners, developers, and other stakeholders, that the PBI is ready.

## User-Centric

The PBI articulates clear user or business value, justifying its priority.

## Notes for the Crew

Ensure all checklist items are reviewed and ticked off during backlog refinement sessions or before sprint planning.

Encourage open discussions about each criterion to ensure shared understanding and agreement.

Adjustments to the checklist should be made collaboratively, reflecting lessons learned and evolving project needs.

This checklist is a living document. It should evolve as the team learns and adapts its processes.
